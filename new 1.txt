(a) what are the main techniques you are featuring in your project? (b) How far along is your implementation (what works, what does not yet work?).
In our project, we will be using feature-based reinforcement learning. Because the state space for the rubik's cube is so large, we will need to
identify features with which we can assign certain states. We think that for our features, we will use certain patterns on the faces. We should be
able to group combinations of patterns together as features, because apart from the colors, states that are rotationally identical can be solved in
the same way. To reduce the size of the state space, we are only considering 180 degree rotations, and are using a 2x2x2 cube. The benefit of this is
that the combination of these two should produce a large number of rotationally symmetric states. With the 180 degree rotation restriction, any given
color can only appear on two of the six possible faces. With the 2x2x2 restriction, we can reduce the number of combinations of faces which form the
list of features. We are using these features in our Markov Decision Process to determine the optimal policy at any given state, or any given feature.
So far, we have finished the problem formulation, as well as made changes to the Markov Decision Process file from assignment 5 to fit our project.
